# BIP_AntiAliaser
### Amazfit Bip watchface elements anti-aliasing using color pixels.
This app adds turquoise&blue pixels to the left of white elements and yellow&red to the right. That makes white symbols' edges a bit anti-aliased. Workd fine only on Amazfit BIP display due to its subpixel structure.
Simply drag&drop the required images or a folder onto an exe file and that's it.
